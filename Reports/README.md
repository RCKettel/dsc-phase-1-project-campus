# Microsoft Market Analysis Phase one Project




## Project Overview

This project aims to describe to Microsoft what specific information is necessary to make a informed decision regarding the future direction of their movie studio. Exploratory data analysis shows a correlation between the ratings of certain movie genres and the box office earnings. Microsoft can use this information to choose which specific genres to target for their early marketing descisions.

### Business Problem

Microsoft is interested in creating their own movie studio and entering the movie market. They are interested in knowing based on market trends of the last ten years which movies make the most at the box office and get the highest ratings. This information will help them make an informed decision for their future marketing plans.

### The Data

IMDb has a large repository of movie data tha includes information on genres, movie titles, and ratings. Included in these databases is a set of data from Box Office Mojo, a subsidiary of IMDb, that contains the foreign and domestic earnings by title and the specific movie's release year. All of this data is data is available online and is updated daily.  For the duration of this project each of these specific datasets will be used from each of the repositories mentioned.

### Methods

This project used Python tools specific to exploratory data analysis for identification of trends among the most common film types.  This information helps answer which popular types of film make the most money.

### Conclusions

Based on the comparison between the mean average rating and the average gross box offfice earnings by the ten types of film the best films that Microsofts new studio could make are comedies like Bill and Ted Face the Music or romantic comedies like Stranger than fiction.

### Next Steps

Since the recomendation for the best movies ignores the movies that are not the highest earners and the best rated of the types of movie investigated, it may be in the best interest of the customer to branch out and invest in thrillers like 23 Bridges or Horror movies like IT after they get a foothold in the market.
